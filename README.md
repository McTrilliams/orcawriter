# dftauto2
## Package for creating DFT calculation submission files for the ORCA 4.0.1 package.



## Next Steps:
- Simplify files
- Tests
- Deploy
- Interface with flask app



### Idea: quantitative crystal comaprisons
* Playing with Crystals (pwc)
* pwc-0001-crystal_spin_state_optimization
* Goal: Analyze the optimizations of the iron hydrazido(2-) complex from JACS 2018

  ### Requirements
  - Root mean square analysis for atom pairs
      - Produce a heat map of the overlays for each spin state
  - Where within the XX% ellipsoid does each atom lay.
      - Heat map
      - Scatter
      - Really cool multi 3D surface overlays?
